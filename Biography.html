        <h1>Mary Jansen</h1>
        <p>
            Mary grew up in culturally diverse San Francisco Bay Area and indulged in all forms of creative stimulation ranging from music and dance to visually rich trips to local museums. She acquired a BFA in Graphic Design at CCA in 1986 to learn the discipline of graphic design as well as other visual fine arts. Though she graduated just before the dawn of computer graphics applications Mary has always felt blessed to have been one of the last students taught the disciplines of exacting, hands-on graphics skills. Students were trained to apply strict adherence to detail and Zen-like focus utilizing precise execution. This disciplined arts oriented ideology has influenced her approach not only to what she does in the studio but to life in general. Of course, she has now learned computer graphics. Mary appreciates one of the most amazing and flexible tools available to the modern day artist/designer. She only hopes her work reflects that of carefully thought-out artistry and evokes sentiments of beauty and balance as good design is meant to do. Hopefully her passion for thought-provoking art coupled with love of the outdoors brings you visual contentment and joy.
